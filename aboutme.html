		<p>Hi everyone! I'm currently a math PhD student at OSU. Before that I was a software engineer at Google and before that I was an undergraduate at UChicago. I have this website because its 2019 and its about time I had an internet presence. I'm developing it myself instead of using a centralized service because I'd rather be uniquely bad than nondescriptly good.</p>

		<p>My goal for the site is for it to be a fun place with weird things of unclear purpose. At the moment I have an experiments page with javascript toys and a blog page with things I've written. I don't know how frequently I will update it or add to it in the future. 
		</p>
		<p> Want to contact me for any reason? Message me on <a href=https://www.chess.com>chess.com</a>. My username is my domain.
