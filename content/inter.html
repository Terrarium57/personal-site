<p> Look at these two gifs I made. </p>
		<div class="container">
			<img class="rowmedia" src="../asset/gif/spiral.gif" alt=spiral>
			<img class="rowmedia" src="../asset/gif/grid.gif" alt=checkers>
		</div>
		<p>I'm thinking I may try my hand at some generative art. This is just a product of messing around with the PIL Python Library (something tells me that L might make this phrase redundant). I know I know, I should be using ImageIO. I may add some of my code to the website later. And I may make more of them.</p>
