<p>Maybe instead of one of those podcasts which get cool new guests on everytime this will be one of those podcasts where the same loveable cast of characters sits down for a riveting and novel conversation. I hope you haven't gotten tired of us yet because we're back to talk about a movie, Midsommar, which we recently watched together. Hope you enjoy. </p>
