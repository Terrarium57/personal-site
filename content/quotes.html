<p>Here are some bite sized thoughts I would post on Twitter if I did that sort of thing. Instead I'm posting them on my own personal Jake Twitter: Jitter. Please enjoy these hand crafted bespoke thoughts. From the interplay of the primordial zeitgeist and my head to yours.</p>

<p>"Late Stage Capitalism" is simultaneously too pessimistic and too optimistic.</p>

<p>Life it too short to be miserable. It's also too long.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of the capabilities a computer and an internet connection give me, and the uses I put them to, causes me an immense amount of despair.</p>

<p>Mistakes are like rats. Where you see one, there are probably dozens. Also they stink.</p>

<p>"The best players are better than anyone" -on tetris players from a popular science podcast.</p>

<p>All we are is muscle and memory.</p>

<p>Half of life is trying new things. The rest of life is doing the same things over and over again.</p>
