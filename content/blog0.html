<p> Hello and welcome to my first blog post. It has risen from the ashes of my old Google Blogger Blog. I've decided its time to have an online presence as a public person. Up to now my attempts have been haphazard and done vaguely ironically, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>My previous Blogger Blog in which I wrote about Magic: the Gathering and nonsense. </li>
<li>RiceBrocolliChicken an Instagram in which I posted pictures of my (identical) breakfast everyday. </li>
	<li>A personal Facebook in which I scrolled more than posted. </li>
</ul>

<p>My goals for this website include: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Exporting my thoughts and values into the wider world. To be better understood and perhaps in aggregate helping the world be better understood.</li>
	<li> To acquire technical skills with AWS and web development.</li>
	<li> To foster a fun and unusual space on the internet which hasn't been created or maintained for any clear purpose. </li>
	<li> To give my dope 4 character URL the home it deserves.</li>
</ul>

<p>This first post is mostly a sketch. I didn't want to wait forever before creating something. In general I want to do more and think less. If that means doing stupid and pointless things then I will do stupid and pointless things. </p>
