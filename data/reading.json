My goal isn't to give a summary or a recommendation, though on occasion I might, but just to give a series of thoughts that I have about the work or that the work made me think. Maybe just share the anecdote of how it ended up on my desk. Something between a blog and a tweet.</p><p>It is an outgrowth of my <a href='blog/res'>resolution</a> to read at least 5 pages of something mathematical everyday. A resolution I've been successful at and which I intend to make small entries about here. In the mean time it's just best sellers though. </p><p> Those who just want one of those categories can use the category filter buttons. </p>"
