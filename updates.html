		<p> On this page I will document my daily updates to the internet. In the beginning it'll mostly be descriptions of how this site has changed but I hope it will eventually become a forest of links to things I've done elsewhere. Originally I intended to use my blog for this purpose but most updates won't need much exposition and many will be simple links. </p>

The data is populated automatically from scryfall via this <a href="https://script.google.com/d/15s1hG2FsfYzKCKven_opYUYbahvGfnVRZXLxFbRBm6Xh0F5ouQEoqn9o/edit?usp=sharing">script</a>.

A stretch goal is to make similar sheets for other sets and make cross comparisons.</p>
