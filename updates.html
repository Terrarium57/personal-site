		<p> On this page I will document my daily updates to the internet. In the beginning it'll mostly be descriptions of how this site has changed but I hope it will eventually become a forest of links to things I've done elsewhere. Originally I intended to use my blog for this purpose but most updates won't need much exposition and many will be simple links. </p>
		<p> 09/25/2019 - I made a spreadsheet with information for Throne of Eldraine cards which you can access <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuSqlD67JEJUFM_6NWKRVho_qPOtA9ADQZ4XhnZ5QHY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The data is populated automatically from scryfall via this <a href="https://script.google.com/d/15s1hG2FsfYzKCKven_opYUYbahvGfnVRZXLxFbRBm6Xh0F5ouQEoqn9o/edit?usp=sharing">script</a>. I plan to add some analysis sheets to determine as fans for various archetypes. Make observations of average sizes of creatures and such. A stretch goal is to make similar sheets for other sets and make cross comparisons.</p>
		<p> 09/24/2019 - I added a puddles animation to my experiments page.</p>
		<p> 09/23/2019 - I uploaded my code to github. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/jakethekoenig/personal-site">here</a>.</p>
		<p> 09/22/2019 - I made this page. </p>
