		<h1>Some Statistical Thoughts on the End of the World</h1>
		<p> Back in high school I remember Mr. Morrel telling us about the pastor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)" target="blank">William Miller</a> who after a careful reading of the bible forecasted the world would end by the year 1844. Back then I thought it was absolutely ridiculous that a man in the 1800s could believe he was living in the end of history. It just seemed like it was in the such distant past. It seems less far away now that I'm older. Paradoxically as historical events drift further in the past they often loom larger in my mind. When I first learned about the halocaust it felt like it was done by people who were very fundamentally not like us in the present day. I don't feel that way anymore. </p>
		<p>My teacher's main point with Miller was that people have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of time. Every major modern day religion has something to say about the end of the world. Their predictions may be vague and allegorical but what is clear is that they are predicting the end of the world. Already something of a bold prediction from past data. With all these unborn out predictions my teacher posited that one shouldn't take them too seriously. And there is a sort of statistical sense to it. If someone correctly predicted the end of the world tomorrow, still only one out of thousands of end of the world forecasts were true. </p>
		<p> Here's a statistical counterpoint, a Jake original. Right now about seven percent of everyone who has ever lived is alive. This is sort of an amazing fact to think about. When I think of all the times I could have been born it seems vanishingly unlikely that I would be born at the capital P, Present day. Or rather that the year 2019 would be my present day. But if I believe the world is ending in my lifetime. Then in fact its not that unlikely. It's about 7%. Its also not an accident of my time that roughly 7% of everyone is alive. Populations grow exponentially. This is in some sense the definition of exponential growth: The area under an exponential curve up to a given point is directly proportional to its height at that point. Now of course human populations don't really grow exponentially. Not all populations have the same fertility rate. There are wars and plagues. But at most points in the past about 7% of people up to that point were still alive. </p>
		<p> So now if you believe human populations will grow roughly exponentially up until the end of the world then you should believe there is a roughly 7% chance you will be alive at the end of the world. Which is a dramatically more troubling figure than the one you'd arrive at by considering the preponderance of failed predictions. </p>
		<p> I have three visions of the future. </p>
		<ul>
		<li> The world essentially ends in the next 50 years. We're already past peak oil and peak production of a number of other important reagents in the global economy. This plus food scarcities from climate degradations lead to interstate conflicts which lead to nuclear war. That or the AIs kill us. Or synthetic plagues created from published virus genomes. Or an asteroid. </li> 
		<li> The next 50 years look a lot like the last and nothing terribly bad or good happens.  </li>
		<li> Amazing advances are made in longevity, space travel and AI. We live in a well organized, peaceful and civilized society.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When I write them all out they all sort of seem vaguely plausible and I don't know how to live my life in the uncertainty. Somehow the middle option seems unlikely. From my perspective we have big problems as a species and without big solutions we won't solve them. But maybe all the disasters I worry about aren't really big deals. And maybe all the technologies I'd like to be optimistic about just don't pan out. </p>

		<h1>Adipsin Summary</h1>
		<p><em> By: Rhiannon Bates </em></p>
		<p><em> Editor's Note: Today we have an article from a special guest talking about her research. If you'd like to write for my blog, contact me. Or just make a git pull request. </em></p>

<p>Hello everyone! I'm Rhiannon, and I will be taking over Jake's blog for today. I'd like to introduce myself first and give you a glimpse into the work I do. I'm currently a PhD student studying Biomedical Sciences with a research focus in neuroregulation of adipose tissue and adeno-associated (AAV) viral design. I also have an MPH in veterinary public health. </p>

<p>My current research project began when Lei Cao (my PI) told me that environmentally enriched mice, mice that are able to socialize and exercise in a large space, are leaner and have remodeled adipose tissue. This is in comparison to mice in standard housing with access to exercise (wheels, etc). Enriched environments have numerous beneficial effects, including improved metabolism and healthy aging. My lab focuses on the metabolic, immune, and hormonal effects via the HSA (hypothalamic sympathetic adrenal) axis. This knowledge is important in understanding mechanisms behind physiologic changes that dramatically improve metabolism and longevity and resistance to pathologies, including cancer. Those of you who know Jake well will know his love for fat. Adipose tissue is innervated and has many roles in metabolic function, communication to the brain, and peripheral tissues. Plus it tastes good.</p>

<p>BDNF, brain derived neurotropic factor, is upregulated in environmentally enriched mice and has been shown to be the molecule behind many of these physiological changes in enriched mice. Mice are used extensively in biomedical research due to their physiological similarity to humans and ease of experimentation. My lab has studied this extensively in the past. qPCR (quantitative PCR) results show that a small molecule, adipsin (otherwise known as complement factor D) is also upregulated in enriched mice, but not mice solely receiving exercise. Adipsin upregulated expression begins early on (around 6 days in mice) and is sustained for months. It is found in adipose tissue regardless of sex, age, and strain of mice. Through my own work the last month or so I have found that adipsin is highly concentrated in the serum of enriched animals, but less concentrated in BTBR mice, which is a model for autism. This may have something to do with the finding that BTBR mice have reduced BDNF signaling. I am interested in understanding the role of BDNF on adipsin expression. </p>

<p>Not much is known about the role adipsin plays when secreted from adipose tissue, but it is a crucial component of the complement system (involved in immune defense against bacterial infections). Recent studies have shown adipsin modulates beta-cell function, which are the cells that produce insulin, indicating it has a role in metabolism. Adipsin stimulates glucose transport for triglyceride accumulation in fat and inhibits lipolysis. In diabetic or obese mice, there is a low level of adipsin expression. Patients with type 2 diabetes with beta-cell failure have low adipsin expression. It is thought that adipsin sustains insulin production and secretion in diabetes because in diabetic mice with injected adipsin, they have lowered fasting glucose levels, increased insulin, and increased glucose clearance. Before you run out and purchase adipsin for increasing your metabolic strength, let me do my job to understand the role it plays within the entire body. For safety, you know. </p>

<p>In obese humans, adipsin is highly expressed at first due to the increased fat mass, then declines with adipose dysfunction. I would like to know how the timing of adipsin expression occurs and the mechanism of its regulation. Another interesting finding from the literature is that in humans, adipsin levels decline during pregnancy, but the mechanism behind this is unclear. </p>

<p>To begin my experiments into adipsin's role, I've been working on designing a virus to deliver adipsin cDNA specifically to adipose tissue. This involves mutating capsid proteins for entering a host cell, and using bacteria to amplify my plasmid DNA. This involves a lot more work than what I just described, most of which is pipetting tiny amounts (microliters) of clear liquid into tiny amounts of another clear liquid. Somehow after pipetting things, results occur and I can verify that the viral construct contains my DNA. My DNA of adipsin was designed by introducing start and stop codons and sequences that enzymes will recognize to cut and insert into a vector plasmid for transfer. I also used some of my lab's money to sequence it. Hopefully I can pay it back to them when I'm rich and famous. </p>

<p>Plasmids are used in gene therapy to carry promoters, antibiotic resistance elements, and other useful sequences to isolate bacteria colonies that contain the plasmid. These plasmids are extracted and packaged into AAV, which can then be transfected into HEK193 cells. By doing so, I can make sure these viruses are able to get inside cells and insert their DNA. GFP, green fluorescent protein, is also contained in the plasmid and used to visualize if the cells took up the plasmid. AAV vectors transiently express the DNA, but lentiviruses can permanently express whatever gene you want to have expressed in a cell. However, using those viruses has random integration into the genome, and could lead to cellular transformation with unintended consequences. Gene therapy for humans relies on AAV mostly, as this is the safest method so far. </p>

<p>Currently I'm working really hard at molecular biology before setting up my in vivo experiments, which I'll be designing a micro-RNA targeting adipsin for destruction in order to knock it out of mice. This past weekend was my birthday and this coming weekend I'm on vacation, though... But in the next several months I will have more information about adipsin. Stay tuned!</p>

		<h1>Itertools, a Love Story </h1>

		<p> I remember when I first learned about while loops. It was my second year of high school. My first year we learned Scheme, a lisp variant. But my second year Mr. Estep taught us Java, and the delight of language specified control structures was given to us. Loops were the focus of a week or two of our course. First we learned about while loops then for loops. I remember at the time thinking how pointless for loops were. Anything that could be accomplished with a for loop could also be done with a while loop. Why would I write: </p>

		<code> for (int i = 0; i&lt n; i++) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Do something</br>
			}
		</code>
		<p> When I could simply write: </p>

		<code> int i = 0; <br>
			while(i &lt n) { <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //Do something <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i++; <br>
      }</code>

		<p> Of course one may argue the for loop takes up slightly fewer characters. But this benefit seemed unconvincing to me in the face of the cost of needing to hold two different iteration constructs in my head. I grew older, and I wrote more code, and eventually I realized that everytime I whipped out my iteration hammer I had some index moving linearly through some data structure and my iteration tool might as well be explicit about what the index is and how its moving. The while construct ostensibly offered more flexibility but really I always iterated in the same way. It was the while loop which was redundant, not the for loop. </p>
		<p> Enter the foreach loop: </p>
		<code> for(Object thing : things) { <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //Do something <br>
			} </code>
		<p> My initial reaction was again that this was pointless redundancy. But as time passed I realized this new briefer loop captured almost all the use cases I needed iteration for and abstracted away a crutch I thought I needed, but didn't really: the index. If I'm trying to compute some statistic from the collection, I don't need the index. If I'm trying to make some new collection, which comes from a transformation of elements of the old collection, I don't need an index. If I'm trying to make a subcollection from my original collection based on some sort of condition, I don't need an index. And those three things, reduce, map, filter, capture maybe 90% of all my iteration use cases. Fast forwarding to my Haskell years at UChicago after Java had been left far behind and I'd switched form Haskell to Python, but still appreciated the Haskell aesthetic. I liked to program like this: </p>
	
		<code>
			reduce(function, collection) <br>
			map(function, collection) <br>
			filter(condition, collection)
		</code>
		<p> And I'd write looooong lines of code composing them to get the result I wanted. In the beginning I thought in terms of base operations and operations on the index were just another operation. Now iteration was itself an operation on functions and collections. My words had gotten bigger and my reach had gotten farther. </p>

		<p> There's one last chapter. What about double for loops? Maybe I want to do some operation on all tuples (i,j), 0&lt=i,j&lt N. Once upon a time I might have written a nested for loop. Or I might have made a map with its subfunction itself an instance of map. But no longer. Now I use itertools! </p>
		<code> from itertools import product <br>
			map(function, product(range(N),2)) </code>
		<p> Such brevity and beauty. No mucking around at the level of indexes or even thinking about whether you're going in a left to right or up to down manner. Just pure data structures and operations. </p>
		<p> Itertools came to my attention when I was googling for the Pythonic way to iterate over subgroups of a group. Once upon a time I would iterate over subgroups of a set of size N by iterating from 0 to 2^N - 1. Each such number encodes whether n is in the subgroup based on whether the nth character in the bitstring is a 0 or a 1. In other words the ith subgroup contains the element j if and only if !(i & (1&lt&ltj) == 0) is true. Yuck! What disgusting code I hacked together. Now I use itertools.combinations like a civilized scholar.

		<h1>Limes are Green, Birds are Black</h1>

		<p>My first impression of public scooters was surprise that some venture capitalists bought some garbage and sprinkled it around urban centers. I like to think of myself as an open minded forward looking person but my first impression of all change is disdain. It took me a bit to realize that I hated cars far more than scooters. I was just more used to them.</p>

		<p>I've only actually used a scooter once when I was visiting Providence. It was about 3 miles from downtown to my airbnb. Instead of summoning a stranger in a metal box to come to me and then go to the airbnb I found a scooter and scooted. During the ride I was overcome with a sense of rightness. That this is the way it should have always been. No wide lanes for huge boxes that carry only one person. No huge fields of concrete to house them in. No struggling to find a place to leave your giant metal box when you don't need it. Looking out my window I'd estimate that more than half of the surface area of Columbus is devoted to the flow and rest of cars. Just on space I feel cars were a horrible move for us as a society. And then there's the sounds and the exhaust. And the way they feel on the inside on hot summers and cold winters. </p>

		<p>But like I said I don't really use them. But I do charge them. I remember hearing an Uber driver on the radio talking about how in the early days he would make $40 an hour and now he was lucky to make $15. And that is why he was trying to organize and collectivize to demand higher wages. Maybe this is a morally wrong perspective on this but it made me wish I had been an uber driver in 2012. And now in 2019 I feel I have another chance to make $40 an hour doing labor literally anyone could do with no more equipment than a phone and some chargers. </p>

		<p>The good news is a really do think you can make $40 an hour. The bad news is you can only do it from 9pm to 9:30 pm and 6am to 6:15am with Lime. Maybe you can do it throughout the day with Bird. But only if you don't count the time spent checking your phone to see if there are any nearby.</p>

		<p>Some more good news is that its delightfully fun though. It's basically Pokemon Go but you get paid for it. You get to explore new places and hunt them down. You get paid more per unit time if you run and figure out ways to transport lots of them at once. I remember when I played Pokemon Go for about 10 minutes I thought the reward of having some pictures of Pokemon a little bit of a letdown. Maybe by now they've implemented some kind of battle. I don't know I haven't played since 2016. But getting real money for your city exploration is pretty nice. It almost makes me feel like I'm doing useful and valuable work. And maybe I am. Sometimes I see people apparenly using them to get around.</p>

		<p><em>Update: At this point I've actually spent a lot of time scooting. But now that I've got a new bike that I like quite a bit I'm going to go back to never scooting. Also I decided that the optimal times of day for scoot charging are too valuable to me to spend scoot wrangling. So I guess now everything in this blog post is the opposite of true. Should have published it sooner I guess. </em></p>

		<h1>Speculation on Why Social Media is Associated with Depression</h1>
		<h3>My observations and aimless speculation</h2>
		<p> This post is a response to some meme in the zeitgeist I've observed that social media depresses people because it shows people other's best selves. You go on Facebook and see all your friends posting about their exciting, fun and perfect lives and start to feel worse about your own shitty life. And of course you're only seeing a curated portion of other's lives. There's two levels of positive selection going on. Your friends are only posting their highlights and only your friends with highlights are posting. My opinion is close to the opposite. Social media is partially depressing because it shows you your friends suffering. But mostly its depressing because staring at a screen is depressing. I'll defend this position poorly, with personal examples of what I see on Facebook and my subjective accounts of my reactions to good and bad news from friends. I'll also give a nefarious and paranoid explanation of the prevalence of the memey interpretation of social media's association to depression. </p>
		<p> People's experience of social media is wildly divergent. In fact that's almost the point and one of the primary innovations over traditional media. One has the choice of many social media sites: Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter are the obvious behemoths. There are also many smaller sites which foster distinct personal cultures like Lesswrong and Hackernews (not to id my own tastes too obviously). Once one has chosen the sites they want to use they have many knobs to turn to get the experience they want. They can follow who they want to follow. They can join the groups they want to group. In a very real sense if people aren't having a good time when they're using social media it's their own fault. I say this as someone who has spent a substantial amount of time on various social media sites having a decidedly not good time. So when I talk about my experiences on social media I'm sure a lot of people won't really know what I'm talking about. I'm also sure a lot of people will. But I don't see people talking about how happy they are or the cool things they're up to. My general interpretation of people's mood from what they post is that they are miserable. It sort of seems the same way to me on Twitter and Reddit. It just doesn't seem to me that healthy, happy people would produce the kind of content I see on these sites. </p>
		<p> My second gripe with this explanation of social media's harm is that its just philosophically implausible to me. When I see my friends happy, I am happier. When I see my friends sad I am sadder. I'm not saying sometimes when they're happiness comes from some material thing I don't have or haven't experienced there isn't some second order effect of jealousy. But I think its dominated by the first order effect of wanting my friends to be happy and successful. When I see vacation photos or baby pictures I don't feel dissatisfied in my own life. Perhaps this isn't the typical emotional response to this stimuli. But I sort of think it is. If instead of asking what in social media makes people sad, you ask what in life makes people happy, I think your list will probably include things like: spending time with friends, exercise, eating good food and doing creative things. Once you've made a list of things that make people happy, and observe that they all take up some time, I think the theory that social media makes people unhappy simply by taking up their time is very plausible.</p>
		<p> My explanation for the traction this theory has in the public mind is insidious manipulation by traditional media. Social media has been extremely successful at doing what traditional media has always aimed to do: consume as much time as possible in its consumer's lives. Traditional sources of media want to steal that time back to their own controlled channels. And to do this they do what they do best: they construct a narrative which portrays their opponent as harmful. But social media and traditional media aren't that distinct. In particular I think the only reason social media is more psychologically harmful than traditional media is because it is more addictive and succeeds more totally in occupying its users' attentions. So to distinguish the two in a way that is plausibly true traditional media has promulgated this view that seeing your friends happy is what is harming users, not just the act of spending time on it itself. This also somewhat explains why the thesis "seeing your friends happy is bad" is spread. Instead of the ostensibly more intuitive "seeing your friends sad is bad". Because its already a popular culture meme that traditional media is extremely depressing because it shows you imagery of all kinds of negative news happening all over the world. Saying social media is bad because it shows you bad things in the world already isn't distinguishing it substantially from traditional media. </p>
		<p> This whole post is obviously a slightly sketchy armchair argument. But I really do think there is something important here. At a later date I may try to firm it up with citations to literature about associations between Depression and Social Media Usage (In particular I'm not sure any studies actually successfully show a causal relationship in either direction, let alone prove a mechanism). I might also go hunting for some traditional media articles talking about the harmfulness of social media. In the mean time I'm going to try to create more and consume less. I encourage you to do the same (yes I'm aware of the contradiction here).</p>

		<h1>The Anthropocene Reviewed Reviewed </h1>

		<p> I'm typing this review as I sip green tea out of my fun coffee mug decorated with pictures of mugs of coffee and synonyms of coffee: Espresso, Java Time, Cappuccino. I received this mug as a gift from friend Bobby in high school. It was a thank you for some favor I did. I remember he asked me if I liked coffee before he gave it to me. I forget what exactly the favor I had done for him was but even at the time I remember thinking it wasn't the sort of favor one needed to reciprocate with a gift. My High School friend Pavleen also owes me a favor. I forget what I did for him, but in my yearbook he wrote "Don't forget about the favor I owe you". I generally look back on my past self (anything more than a few hours really) as an unreliable piece of shit but recalling these anecdotes makes me think I might be biased. I'm at least an unreliable unreliable piece of shit.</p>

		<p> This is what every episode of John Green's podcast The Anthropocene Reviewed is like. A sprawling trail of associations that leaves you forgetting what the original point was but feeling a new sense of connection to the objects around you and the past. As John Green will remind you Faulkner told us: "The past is never dead. It's not even past".</p>

		<p>This podcast came to my attention as an Allen Wu recommendation. Allen also introduced me to: Los Campesinos, Mitski, St. Vincent and Python 3. By carefully letting Allen know everything he tells me about is the best thing ever I've conditioned him to let me know about all the best stuff. But this article isn't about 4.5 star Allen recommendations but about John Green's podcast the Allen Wu recommendation. </p>

		<p>I remember listening to it for the first time driving with my girlfriend, Rhiannon. Recommendation in hand I just put it on the car aux. My first impression was it was a strange album cover art. As John Greene's calm voice came over the speaker, telling me about about Grey Alien's origin's in the zeigeist and his own childhood fear that everyone around him was an alien decieving him, I realized my expectations had been flummoxed. I quickly apologized and handed the aux back to Rhiannon. Later as I moved into our new apartment together I listened to episode after episode as I drove back and forth from my old house with Math department friends and Rhiannon's old house with OSU housing strangers. Each episode was a calming bite sized delight. At first I skipped the ads but then I came to enjoy the strange weaving of product placement into the middle of each episode. John advertised for the same companies over and over. But each time he sold it with a new absurd premise. Most podcasts compell me to frantically skip 15 seconds repeatedly two or three times. But with the Anthropocene Reviewed I let it spin me into a meditative trance throughout the precisely just shy of 30 minutes episodes. </p>

		<p>Because I did no research before indulging in Allen Wu's recommendation I did not realize it was even by a person who was famous independent of the project, let alone John Greene. His introduction where he says "I'm John Greene and this is the Anthropocene Reviewed" probably should have tipped me off. But someone John's name is just generic enough that it didn't flag my recognition. I remember thinking "this anecdote is familiar" when John told his anecdote about his old boss recommending Harvey; a movie I myself watched with my dad when I was much younger. One of the best movies my dad got from Blockbuster for us. Or maybe that was already post Netflix. It didn't click until John said "When I was writing the Fault in Our Stars...", when I immedietly felt like an idiot.</p>

		<p>Like all nonfiction media intended for entertainment, its at its best when you're not really familiar with the subject matter. But somehow the episodes on Tetris and Mariokart still managed to teach my somethings. For readers who don't know, I was #6 on the now defunct TetrisFriends. Once at Google I told a coworker that I didn't think I had enough domain knowledge about anything to write a book. And then later in the conversation when Mariokart came up and I pontificated on which carts were the best, and at what place threshold you should try to improve on a banana, he said he thought I could write a book about Mariokart. Which is perhaps true, if people were interested in my deep insights into Doubledash and Wii Mariokart. I'm not universally a Luddite when it comes to Nintendo games, though smash ended with Melee. In my second year of college when I drank coffee for the first time and finished the essay I was working on just under two hours later I proceeded to play Mariokart 8 all night. In my mind it represents a substantial improvement in the franchise artistically. The stages were so whimsical and bright, the designs Escherian. Typing this out almost makes me want to run out and get the latest Nintendo console. </p>

		<p>I'm a sucker for art that weaves together quaint trivia and deep emotional truths. Some highlight episodes for me are the Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Contest, Hawaiian Pizza and Geese, the only episode I played twice to share with my girlfriend, because of our shared hatred of the water fowl. I recommend the Anthropocene Reviewed to anyone who enjoys podcasts or learning things they'll immedietly forget. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars. </p>

		<h2> Blogging in Earnest </h2>
		<p> I've decided going forward I want to add something permanent to the internet at least once a day. I've let myself become a spectator in online communities in a way that is really not good. I have so much to say and I really ought to start screaming out on this platform that no one knows about. I want to get into the habit of creating things. I don't create anything, I only consume. Even my present work is just consumption. The goal is to keep eating up math papers until I understand enough to contribute. But how can I hope to contribute big things if I cannot contribute small things? I have all kinds of pie in the sky ideas for things I could make. Truly I live in wonderful times. There is nothing stopping me from making music, video games, writing, art which could in theory reach millions of people. I have all the technology at my fingertips right now to make any string of text, to make any sound to edit any image. I've just gotta start imagining things. I've got to turn off the part of my brain that enumerates the things I need to learn to get started. Or the part of my brain that thinks about how much time it'll take to make something at all competent. And how even after some sort of competency is achieved there is no guarantee of ever making something I'll be satisfied with. </p>
		<p> So my goal is to make something permanently and publicly available on the internet everyday. To make things easy for myself in the beginning I imagine a lot of those things will be blog posts. Hopefully not too many of them will be meta blog posts but I've really got to start somewhere. I can't wait until I'm ready. I've been waiting for a long time. In the long term I'd like to make this site beautiful. I have ideas for Android Apps and Youtube videos. I think it'd be cool to make a math podcast. I'd like to make some illustrations. I'd like to stream myself doing programming contests and mtgo tournaments. So many ideas and so little time! </p>
		<p> All my worries about this project fade away when I state them concretely. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> What if the things I say are stupid and pointless? No one will read them anyway! Who cares? Maybe if they're obviously stupid someone will let me know and I will benefit. </li>
			<li> What if someday I'm a <i>serious</i> person and I'm embarrassed by my work here? Well I can always delete it. And lots of artists have early work that doesn't stand up to their eventual standards. The early XKCDs are a little weird and not in the later regular style. It's naive expect to start doing good work before producing mountains of shitty work. Maybe its vaguely pointless to publish shitty work but the process of using html, js etc. and AWS are themselves things I want to improve at. </li>
			<li> My css is ugly! Well I can change that before I go and post this site anywhere. So that doesn't really matter. I bet in the year 20XX when readers have gotten down here they won't know what this bullet is even about! </li>
			<li> I don't have the time to content daily! Even content that is barely above stream of conscious! Bullshit! I have so much time. If I just took all the time I spend consuming things and instead produced something I'd have oodles of time to produce all the shit I want. And I deeply believe I'd be better for it. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Hopefully having made a public commitment I'll stick to it. Not that I have a history of honoring commitments. Now seems like a good time to start. I gotta start before its too late.</p>

		<h2> Sometimes the Trees are Beautiful </h2>
		<p> Sometimes I look out my window and see a mass of leaves and branches swaying in the breeze and think to myself: My god those shades of greens. Those shadows and limes and verdes. I could soak in the infinite unexplainable inexplicable complexity peering in at me through my window forever. I could ponder the alternating twigs of leaves coming off main branches. I could wonder about the evolutionary pros and cons of spiky leaves and rounded ovals. Here's the view from my porch:</p>

<p> Wow, what a paradise of abundance. Here for me and all my neighbors.</p>
<p> Last fall I was walking down some streets near my old home and every tree jumped out at me. Such a cacophony of reds and oranges and yellows. The way they reached their veiny hands through the overcast sky, painting an intricate ceiling overhead. I just walked down the street taking picture after picture. There was this one:</p>
<img class="pictures" src="pics/tree1.jpg" alt=tree>
<p> And all of these:</p>
<div class="container">
	<img class="rowpics" src="pics/tree2.jpg" alt=tree>
	<img class="rowpics" src="pics/tree3.jpg" alt=tree>
	<img class="rowpics" src="pics/tree4.jpg" alt=tree> 
</div>
<p> I remember one unseasonably cold day in April when I wasn't looking forward to the day but on my walk to the tower I realized peering through the fog I was surrounded by somber dignified ancient creatures. They watch me pass day after day. And would watch millions like me go by. I am such a small part of such a beautiful world. And I am so lucky to be a part of it.</p>
<p> One time as an undergrad I was with a person on acid. And they were stunned by the beauty of the sun on the lake. I let them know I thought it was weird they were taking a picture. The sun looked the same that day as it did everyday. The next day they'd look back at it with their normal eyes. If they ever did look back. But I understand now. I understand now.</p>
<p> But I don't feel like this right now. I have some papers I need to read that I don't feel like reading. I keep refreshing newsfeed websites which never show me anything nice. I wish I knew why sometimes the world was beautiful and sometimes it just was.</p>

		<h2> Blog 0 </h2>

		<p> Hello and welcome to my first blog post. It has risen from the ashes of my old Google Blogger Blog. I've decided its time to have an online presence as a public person. Up to now my attempts have been haphazard and done vaguely ironically, including: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>My previous Blogger Blog in which I wrote about Magic: the Gathering and nonsense. </li>
			<li>RiceBrocolliChicken an Instagram in which I posted pictures of my (identical) breakfast everyday. </li>
			<li>A personal Facebook in which I scrolled more than posted. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>My goals for this website include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Exporting my thoughts and values into the wider world. To be better understood and perhaps in aggregate helping the world be better understood.</li>
			<li> To acquire technical skills with AWS and web development.</li>
			<li> To foster a fun and unusual space on the internet which hasn't been created or maintained for any clear purpose. </li>
			<li> To give my dope 4 character URL the home it deserves.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This first post is mostly a sketch. I didn't want to wait forever before creating something. In general I want to do more and think less. If that means doing stupid and pointless things then I will do stupid and pointless things. </p>
